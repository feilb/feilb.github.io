Yesterday was August 23rd, 2013. It was an inauspicious day, marked, perhaps for some, by the threat of an oncoming school year and not much else. To me it wasn't a holiday, nor my birthday. Heck, I even had to work. By all measures, the 23rd day of August was just another day.
 
Yet.
 
Back up 10 years and a day and, while my life circumstances were much different, the date "August 23rd" held a similarly trivial significance. At a little over 18 years old, my thoughts were focused on the immediate, impending hardship of waking up early for my 5:30am shift and perhaps the fact that I would be headed off to college in a matter of weeks. I'd probably stayed up too late the night before playing video games. I guess my life circumstances weren't _that_ different.
 
Apart from the ungodly hour of waking, _the_ August 23rd began without event. Early mornings in the nursing home kitchen start out slow and quiet. Fellow co-workers silently trudge around, cutting grapefruit, setting out water glasses, and burning themselves on the toaster, pulling themselves willfully out of the grip of the sleep they are missing out on. As the first bowls of oatmeal go out to early-rising residents, conversation starts to perk up. With an increase in the number of diners and altitude of the sun, so the pace and energy of the day increases and builds up a sort of steam that, on any other day, would hurtle one clear through the lunch meal and out into the rest of the day. There was a certain exhileration in having completed a full day's work before many of your peers had much more than their breakfast.

This day-- _the_ August 23rd-- was somewhat different than most of those days.

Somewhere between the end of lunch break and the start of brewing lunch coffee I was intercepted by a familiar face. The director of the nursing home was a common sight, usually accompanied by a brief, polite greeting as she buzzed about doing whatever it is that nursing home directors do. This time our interaction was more specific than a casual hello. 

_"Brandon, why don't you come up front with me. There's a police officer outside who wants to talk to you."_ 

Now, I was a pretty straight-laced kid in high school who had little objective reason for concern in front of a police officer, but such an event and such a request are never met with calm nerves. 

_"Uh.. o-ok.."_ 

My mind and heart were sent racing with anxiety; I probably had a hundred thoughts before I hit the front door. Just outside, the police officer and my brother Jonathan were waiting. My brother was crying. 

_"What's going on? What did you do!?"_ 

I think even the most well-intentioned older brothers take a somewhat acusatory tone when their younger sibling shows up escorted by the police, nevermind the fact that it was maybe 11am on a Saturday morning. How much trouble can one get into by that hour?

I've often thought back on that moment just before my brother spoke. Every possible explanation for that particularly odd meeting swirled through my head. 

_"I-I uh.. I don't know how to tell you this, but--"_

He had the tone and intonation of voice one gets when fighting back tears. A fight he wasn't winning. I wouldn't either.

My mom was 42. Not old, even by a teenager's standard.

There's an incredible amount of fuzzy, surreal detail I could dive into about what those first few hours and days were like. Perhaps you've gone through the same or similar and know. Maybe not and you can imagine. What got me through those first few hours and days, however, had little to do with me and much more to do with her.

She was warm and and loving, but inspiring of respect. Utterly consistent. Giving of her time. A stay-home mom for most of my life and a teacher's aid the rest. She was artistic and talented, unpretentious and level-headed. She bowled with friends sometimes. I'm not sure that she was a 300 bowler, but I'm fairly certain she had a heck of a time. I'm sure they did too. Not the oldest among her 6 brothers and sisters, but the one everyone looked up to. Candid, but not judgemental. Deep down we are all convicted when we part from the path we know we should be on, but for one reason or another have chosen not to be. In a way that I still look up to and admire, she simply did the right thing, even when it would have been convenient or easy not to. She was funny too. In fact, we had a closed casket funeral because she once joked that she would want it that way so people wouldn't look up her nose. She was a heck of a mom. Maybe the best. 

I think these were the reasons over six-hundred people stood in lines around the block in a tiny speck of a town, waiting hours to offer their condolences and support for my family and pay their respects at the visitation. I know they are the reasons I still miss her terribly.

Now would be a good time to mention my dad who, in the face of such incredible trial, managed to carry on in holding together a grief stricken family of four kids. I aspire to his strength. Maybe corney to call your dad a hero, but if there is such a thing, he has been mine.

Every milestone I pass in my life, I think about her. The first time I came home from college. Graduating. My wedding. My first kid, and, just 3 weeks ago, my second. At every one wishing for the experience of seeing the pride she would have undoubtedly had. 

In Romans, Paul writes:

_"And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose" - Romans 8:28_

It's a verse that has offered immeasurable consolation and strength in the face of what seemed an insurmountable obstacle. I am who I am as a result of the 18 years my mom spent raising me, _**and**_ of the 10 years since. The trials and challenges, successes and failures, days of great significance and days of inconsequence have, by God's mercy, worked for _my_ good.

_All_ things. 

Yesterday was just another day-- but a day of great significance.
