Yesterday was August 23rd, 2013. It was an inauspicious day, marked, perhaps, by the threat of an oncoming school year and not much else. To me it wasn't a holiday, nor my birthday. Heck, I even had to work. By all measures, the 23rd day of August was a day like any other day.
 
Yet.
 
Back up 10 years and a day and, while my life circumstances were much different, the date "August 23rd" held a similarly trivial significance. At a little over 18 years old, my thoughts were focused on the immediate, impending hardship of waking up early for my 5:30am shift at the nursing home and perhaps the fact that I would be headed off to college in a matter of weeks. I'd probably stayed up too late the night before playing video games. I guess my life circumstances weren't _that_ different.
 
Apart from the ungodly hour of waking, _the_ August 23rd (the only such date that merits an article) began without event. Early mornings in the nursing home kitchen start out slow and quiet. Fellow co-workers silently trudge around, cutting grapefruit, setting out water glasses, and burning themselves on the toaster, pulling themselves willfully out of the grip of the sleep they are missing out on. As the first bowls of oatmeal go out to early-rising residents, conversation starts to perk up. With increases in the number of diners and altitude of the sun, so does the pace and energy of the day increase, building up a sort of steam that, on any other day, would hurtle one clear through the lunch meal and out into the rest of your day. There was a certain exhileration in having completed a full days work before many of your peers had had much more than their morning (perhaps afternoon) bowl of cereal.

This day-- _the_ August 23rd-- was somewhat different than most of those days.

Somewhere between the end of lunch break and the start of brewing lunch coffee I was intercepted by a familiar face. The director of the nursing home was a common sight, usually accompanied by a brief, polite greeting as she buzzed about doing whatever it is that nursing home directors do. This time our interaction was more specific than a casual hello. 

_"Brandon, why don't you come up front with me. There's a police officer outside that wants to talk to you."_ 

Now, I was a pretty straight-laced kid in high school who had little objective reason for concern in front of a police officer, but such an event and such a request are never met with calm nerves. 

_"Uh.. o-ok.."_ 

My mind and heart were sent racing with anxiety; I probably had a hundred thoughts before I hit the front door. Just outside, the police officer and my brother Jonathan were waiting. My brother was crying. 

_"What's going on? What did you do!?"_ 

I think even the most well-intentioned older brothers take a somewhat acusatory tone when their younger sibling shows up escorted by the police, mevermind the fact that it was maybe 11am on a Saturday morning. How much trouble can one get into by that hour?

I've often thought back on that moment, trying to put myself into that brief moment of time before my brother spoke when every possible explanation for that particularly odd meeting swirled through my head. 

_"I-I uh.. I don't know how to tell you this, but--"_

Jonathan spoke in the tone and intonation of voice one gets when fighting back tears. He wasn't winning the fight. I wouldn't either.

My mom was 42. Not old, even by a teenager's standard.
